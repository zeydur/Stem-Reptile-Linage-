# Molecular Innovations of Stem Reptile Linage

The aim of this M.Sc. Bioinformatics individual project is to conduct a genome-scale investigation of molecular innovations on the stem lineage of reptiles. The primary objective is to identify evolutionary events such as expansions and contractions of specific gene families within reptilian species. By analyzing these gene families, the unique traits that contribute to the distinctiveness of reptiles will be defined and characterized. For this purpose, several steps were performed to achieve the objectives of the project. The following steps were undertaken:
